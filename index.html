    <p>Field Marshal Sam Hormusji Framji Jamshedji Manekshaw[5] MC (3 April 1914 â€“ 27 June 2008),
     widely known as Sam Manekshaw and Sam Bahadur ("Sam the Brave"),
     was the Chief of the Army Staff of the Indian Army during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971,
     and the first Indian Army officer to be promoted to the rank of field marshal.
     His active military career spanned four decades and five wars,
     beginning with service in the British Indian Army in World War II.</p>

    <p>Manekshaw joined the first intake of the Indian Military Academy, Dehradun, in 1932.
    He was commissioned into the 4th Battalion, 12th Frontier Force Regiment.
    In World War II, he was awarded the Military Cross for gallantry.
    Following the partition of India in 1947, he was reassigned to the 8th Gorkha Rifles.
    Manekshaw was seconded to a planning role during the 1947 Indo-Pakistani War and the Hyderabad crisis, and as a result,
    he never commanded an infantry battalion.
    He was promoted to the rank of brigadier while serving at the Military Operations Directorate.
    He became commander of 167 Infantry Brigade in 1952 and served in this position until 1954 when he
    took over as the Director of Military Training at Army Headquarters.</p>

    <p>After completing the higher command course at the Imperial Defence College,
    he was appointed General Officer Commanding the 26th Infantry Division.
    He also served as the Commandant of the Defence Services Staff College.
    In 1961, Manekshaw made derogatory comments about the political leadership
    which allowed his opponents to label him as unpatriotic, and he was charged with sedition.
    After being exonerated in the subsequent court of inquiry,
    he took command of IV Corps in November 1962.
    The next year, Manekshaw was promoted to the position of army commander and
    took over Western Command, transferring in 1964 to the Eastern Command.</p>

    <p>Having already commanded troops at division, corps and regional levels,
    Manekshaw became the seventh chief of the army staff in 1969.
    Under his command, Indian forces conducted victorious campaigns against Pakistan in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971,
    which led to the creation of Bangladesh in December 1971.
    He was awarded the Padma Vibhushan and the Padma Bhushan,
    the second and third highest civilian awards of India.</p>
